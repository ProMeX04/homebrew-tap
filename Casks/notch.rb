  caveats <<~EOS
    Notch is currently distributed ad-hoc signed (not notarized).
    If macOS opens it with no visible UI or blocks it, run:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Notch.app
      open -a Notch

    Notch runs as a menu bar / notch utility, so it may not show a Dock icon.
